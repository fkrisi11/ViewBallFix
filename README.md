#### A tool to calibrate your avatar's viewpoint

This tool helps you with making sure what you see in the editor (outside of play mode) is the exact view point you will get to use, when using your avatar on VRChat.

Steps to follow for calibration:
1. Install View Ball Fix
2. Install Av3 Emulator / Gesture Manager
3. Add either Av3 Emulator or Gesture Manager to the scene
4. Open ``TohruTheDragon/View Ball Fix``
5. Drag your avatar from your hierarchy, into the ``Avatar Descriptor`` field
6. Make sure you have either Av3 Emulator or Gesture Manager in your scene
7. Click ``Begin Calibration``
8. Wait until it finishes, and you are back to Edit mode
9. Apply the new position by clicking the ``Apply Calibrated Position`` button
<br><br>
Optional steps:
10. If the viewpoint is still off to the side, go to the ``Settings`` tab of the tool and enable ``Debug mode``
11. Click ``Apply Calibrated (with X)``
<br><br>
12. If you are unhappy with the view position for some reason, either use the ``Apply Original Position`` button, or set the viewball back manually in the avatar's descriptor

### Note: Do NOT calibrate again, while a calibrated position is already set on your avatar, as this will get you bad view position values.
